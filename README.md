# MethGET
A bioinformatics pipeline for correlating DNA methylation and gene expression

MethGET provides 6 major analyses, four for single-methylome analyses and two for multiple-methylome analyses

Single-methylome analyses
  - Correlation analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression
  - Ordinal association analyses with genes ranked by gene expression level
  - Distribution of DNA methylation by groups of genes with different expression level
  - Average methylation level profiles with different expression groups around genes
 

Multiple-methylome analyses
  - Gene level association between changes of DNA methylation and changes of gene expression
  - Heatmap representation of DNA methylation and gene expression data together
